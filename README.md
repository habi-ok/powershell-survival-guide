# PowerShell Survival Guide

_When work gives you lemons..._

## Versions

![The blue icon represents the older version 5, while the newer versions have the black icon](./billder/powershell_versions.png)

PowerShell comes in different versions, and some of the commands in this guide might not work in older versions. Some machines may only have the older version 5 installed (Windows PowerShell), while others come with both version 5 and version 7.

The newer versions of PowerShell are built on .NET Core and are supported on Linux as well.

**‚ö†Ô∏è If possible, always use the latest version ‚ö†Ô∏è**

You can check your PowerShell version with the following command:

```ps1
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

## Terminal Emulators

While you can use the default terminal emulator, there are certain advantages to using alternatives like [cmder](https://cmder.app/), [Wezterm](https://wezterm.org/), [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/), or the reliable [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

If you're unsure, Windows Terminal is a solid choice‚Äîit has all the features you'd expect from a modern emulator and is well-supported on Windows.

## Changing Settings

Most customization is done in PowerShell, but you may also need to tweak your emulator settings, such as keybindings, navigation, tabs, font, and color scheme.

Changing your PowerShell settings is typically done by modifying `$PROFILE`. Every time you open a new console, the contents of `$PROFILE` are executed.

The easiest way to edit these settings is by opening the profile in your editor of choice:

```ps1
code $PROFILE
```

or

```ps1
nvim $PROFILE
```

Changes will take effect in new shell sessions after saving the file. Existing shells will not reflect the changes.

If nothing else, you may want to improve the tab completion behavior. Add this line to `$PROFILE` to get an autocomplete experience similar to Linux and macOS:

```ps1
Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete
```
